    JS Events Mini Projects
------------------------------

------------------------------
    Drum Kit:
------------------------------

Use keydowns to begin playing a specific sound.  

If another key is pressed the first sound should stop playing and the next sound should start.  

Style it up with little animations on each keypress!

------------------------------
	To Do List:
------------------------------

Build a  to-do list.  Render the “to dos” from an input to a list when enter is pressed or a button is click. 
Also, a delete and/or cross out button for the “to do” item.  

Create a button that sorts “to dos” in alphabetical order or the reverse. 
You can also make a drop down that organizes by multiple different categories such as date added or even urgency 
(this would be a field users fill out on creation)!

Create a search filter to look for specific items in your to do list.  

------------------------------
	Dino Jump:
------------------------------

Build a dino jump game.  Try to do this on your own first, without using youtube or other outside materials.  
Think about how to make an object move up or down in css and how we would use js to do this.  
Think about how we can use the event properties of the event object to check if our object is in a specific position relative to another object. 

If you manage to build this add a score tracker and play again button.

If you’re feeling ambitious add a double jump ability and incoming blocks at different heights to make your game more exciting!
